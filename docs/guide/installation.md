There are a few recommended ways to get DataStore2 into your game.

It is recommended that however way you get it, you put it in `ServerScriptService`, as you can only use DataStore2 on the server anyway.

### Method 1: Model File (Roblox Studio)
* Download the `rbxmx` model file attached to the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/Roblox/releases).
* Insert the model into Studio into `ServerScriptService`.

### Method 2: Filesystem
* Copy the `DataStore2` directory into your codebase
* Use [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) to sync the files into your place
